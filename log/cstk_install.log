If you enjoy using tab completion with scripts, you're in luck!
A tab completion script is available for you to use.
To enable tab completion, you need to add a 'source' command to the /root//root/.zshrc file.
I will not modify your personal files without permission.
Please select an option:
1 - Add 'source' to /root/.zshrc file now.
2 - I will add the line manually.
3 - No tab completion.
Please add the following line to your /root/.zshrc file manually:
source /home/adam/Documents/Github/CyberSecurityToolKit/bin/tab_complete.cstk
I installed a Wrapper script in /usr/local/bin/ folder, Please dont move or change or this program will not work.
I did this for 3 reasons.
1 - so we dont need to source the full bin directory in your bashrc.
2 - so we dont need to add multipal files to PATH.
3 - Should you ever decide to remove this program the cleanup process is much easier and safer.
