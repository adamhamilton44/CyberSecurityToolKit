# Classes Information File

The Classes used in this script are split into four sections 

- OSINT
- PAYLOADS
- POST EXPLOIT
- ETC

Lets look at each class and get a idea how we can use this information to help us have success.

## OSINT

Open Source Intelegence is the method of searching the internet for information that we can use to our advantage

Examples may include pictures of a person of interest at there work with a note on there computer of there password.

Checking for [breached passwords](https://haveibeenpwned.com)

Google Dorks *inurl:/wp-content/uploads/ ext:txt username | user name | uname | user | userid | user id AND password | pass word | pwd | pw* 

Check where a picture was taken [Reverse Image Search](https://www.reverseimagesearch.com/)

Just to name a few, In simple terms OSINT is finding information about a person, place or thing using freely available information.

## PAYLOADS

Payloads could just as well be called a virus for computers, A payload is used to help aid in gaining entry in order to infect, elevate privileges, steal information and stay hiden.

A payload usually (not oweas) will send a message to the threat actors computer, this way the threat actor knows you've been hooked and he is able to run commands on your computer from his computer.

Payloads are the reason we have AntiViruses.

## POST EXPLOIT

As the name sounds these are tools we want to use after the payload has hooked the victim's computer and know we want to maintain out persentence.

These tools usually try to aid in giving a threat actor elevated privileges a.k.a. Admin or Root.

In a business setting where a company may have 100's of compuers these tools aid in helping us pivot to other computers.

## ETC

These are tools that dont fit in the other option's but can be very usefull for our success.

# Final Thoughts

As you may have started to understand these Classes are ordered in the same way a person would try to hack into and control a computer.

First we would research the person or company using information freely available on the internet (OSINT).

Next we would try to gain access to the computer using a (PAYLOAD).

Once we have gained access we would try to elevate our user to a Admin or Root to gain total control using a (POST EXPLOIT).

If we have trouble along the way we may need to try to use some other methods (ETC).

**WARNING** Remember Hacking without permission into a system is illegal and may lead to jail time and/or fines.
