# POST EXPLOIT Tool: File Permissions Exploit

This guide explains how to use the `file permissions exploit` script to perform a file permissions search on users computer. 

The script fetches and displays various details about bad file permissions that can aid in escalating user's role from a standard user to a Admin or Root user.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure that the following requirement is met:

- **python3**: A scripting language heavly used in Linux systems. The script checks if `python3` is installed. If it's not, the script will output an error message and exit.

- **GTFOB.py**: (included in repo) A Python script used in the checking of file permissions and searching online resources for vulnabilities.

## Usage

No user Input is required

### Step 1: Clear the Screen

The script begins by clearing the terminal screen for a clean output display.

### Step 2: Check for python3 Installation and the GTFOB.py script

The script verifies if `python3` and `GTFOB.py` is installed on the system:

- If `python3` or `GTFOB.py` is not installed, an error message `Error: GTFOB.py or python3 is not installed.` will be displayed, and the script will exit.
- If `python3` and `GTFOB.py` is installed, the script proceeds to the next step.

### Step 3: Check File Permissions

- If Privilege Escalation Executable(s) are found the script will report `Possible Privilege Escalation Found` along with 3 fields

  - Where the Privilege Escalation was found (Path)

  - What Exploit is used to abuse the file permissions (Attack Type)

  - What command to run to exploit the bad file permissions (Code)

## Conclusion

This script is a simple and effective way to perform Privilege Escalation lookup on misconfigured file permissions and retrieve relevant details. 

Ensure that `python3` and `GTFOB.py` is installed and follow the prompts to get the information you need.
