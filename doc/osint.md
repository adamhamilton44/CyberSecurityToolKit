# CLASS HELP

The Classes used in this script are split into four sections

- OSINT

- PAYLOADS

- POST EXPLOIT

- ETC

Lets take a look at each class and get a idea of the tools available for each class.

## OSINT
 
In simple terms OSINT is finding information about a person, place or thing using freely available information.

    - osint stands for *open source intelligence*

    - osint is the practice of gathering, analyzing, and disseminating publicly available information.

    - osint is your first means of gathering information on people (Jon Doe), places (google headquarters), or things (cryptominers).

    - The internet is full of facts and information, finding the ways of best practice to retrieve only the needed information for success is the hard part.

    - ip lookup

    - ping sweeper

    - nmap helper

    - pawned email/password parsing

## PAYLOADS

A payload is malware that will help aid in gaining entry in a computer and hiding so not to be found.

    - A payload is a program or script designed to *infect* a operating system

    - There are many types of payloads that are given different names based on how they infect a system.

    - A few different types of payloads are: viruses, worms, trojans, and ransomware.

    - These scripts supply some payloads, if the target system uses a anti virus they may be useless without a **exploit**.

    - Tools Available in Payloads Class are:

    - Netcat Binding Shell

    - Netcat Reverse Shell

    - Linux Backdoor creation 

    - Ransomware Encryption on a remote computer

    - Ransomware Decryption on a remote computer

## POST EXPLOIT

These tools are used after a threat actor has gained access to a target computer.

    - They aid in searching for important files for the purpose of 

    - ganing elevated priviledges 

    - stealing passowrds

    -  finding crypto cash wallets

    - placing even more destrucive programs on the target computer.

    - these tools are mostly automated and require very little user interaction.

## ETC

These are tools that dont fit in the other catagories but are helpfull for success.

    - These Tools are safe, will not be flaged by anti-virus and can be ran on a personal computer

    - Users and Shells

    - Python Web Server

    - Archive File Extraction

    - Random byte Generator

## Final Thoughts

These Tools can help aid a Hacker in there daily tasks

from the beginning using osint intellegence to gain information on a person, place, or thing

until delivering of a payload to gain access to target computer and then encrypting the computer **CyberSecurityToolKit** is here to help.

## WARNING

Remember Hacking without permission into a system is illegal and may lead to jail time and/or fines.

I can not and will not be held responable for any dumb actions you may decide to take.

These tools are here for learning.
