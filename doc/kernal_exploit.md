# Kernel Exploit Detection Script

This guide explains how to use a script to check for known kernel exploits on a Linux system. The script compares the system's kernel version against a list of known vulnerable versions and displays any matched exploits.

## Script Overview

The script performs the following steps:

1. **Define Known Exploits**: It maintains an associative array of known kernel exploits, where the keys are kernel version patterns, and the values are the corresponding CVE identifiers.
2. **Check Kernel Version**: It retrieves the system's current kernel version and compares it against the patterns in the exploits list.
3. **Output Results**: If any matches are found, it lists the relevant CVEs. If no matches are found, it states that no exploits were detected.

## Usage

### Step 1: Run the Script

Execute the script from the Post Exploit Class. It will automatically:

- Retrieve the system's kernel version using.
- Loop through the defined exploit patterns to see if the system's kernel version matches any of them.

### Step 2: Review the Output

The script will output one of the following:

- A list of CVE identifiers if the system's kernel version matches any known exploits:
    ```
    <.>CVE-2008-4210
    <.>CVE-2009-1337
    ...
    ```
- The number of exploit "hits" found:
    ```
    2 hits
    ```
- If no matches are found, it will state:
    ```
    No exploits found
    ```

## Code Explanation

- Initialize a count for detected exploits
- Define known exploits as an associative array
- Get the current kernel version
- Check if the current kernel matches any known exploit patterns
- Output the results
- Provide final summary
- Clean up temporary file

## Conclusion

The script is a fast and easy way to find known exploits to gain or elevate user permissions.
